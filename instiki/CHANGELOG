* 0.16.3: Big steps, Rails 2.3.0-RC1 and tons of new stuff!

All the patching, developing and great hacking from Jacques Distler was
merged into the main codebase of instiki. Jaques is now also maintaining the
main branch (together with parasew), which brings instiki up-to-date!

Find more information about all the changes in his site:

  http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/instiki/

New Features:
* Instiki comes and runs with Rails 2.3.0-RC1
* New Markdown interpreter: Maruku
* Default markup dialect is Markdown+itex2MML
* Mathematics suport, using itex2MML (Markdown+itex2MML)
     http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MMLcommands.html
  or BlahTeX (Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG)
     http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/instiki/show/BlahTeX
* Theorem Environments
* Automatic Equation numbering and automatic Theorem numbering,
* Integrated presentation software
     http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/instiki/show/S5
  complete with support for themes
  (available with Markdown, Markdown+itex2MML or Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG)
* Sends application/xhtml+xml to compatible browsers
  (available with Markdown, Markdown+itex2MML or Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG)
  Serve Webs which use non-Markdown Text Filters (Textile, RDoc or Mixed) as
  text/html. This makes those Text Filters usable, again.
* Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) enabled
  (available with Markdown, Markdown+itex2MML or Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG).
* Nifty SVG Logo
  (available with Markdown, Markdown+itex2MML or Markdown+BlahTeX/PNG).
* Atom 1.0 feeds.
* ETag support.
* Filesystem-based caching.
* New, industrial-strength Sanitizer (anti-XSS protection).
* Uses xhtmldiff for redline diff pages.
* (Actually functional) LaTeX output.
* InterWeb WikiLinks
* Add a user interface to manage uploaded files.
* Add a user interface to delete a Web.
* Add a user interface to delete orphaned pages in a Category. In addition to
  deleting all orphaned pages, you can now delete just the orphaned pages in a
  particular category. Among other things, this provides a handy way to delete
  a (selection of) page(s): just assign them to a new category (“delete”, say)
  and delete the orphaned pages in that category.
* Add the manage_fixtures plugin for easy database migration
* Descriptions in the File Upload Dialog are used as the default alt text (for
  pictures) or the default link text (for files).

Bugfixes:
(see http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001893.html for a
complete list)

* fixes to xhtmldiff
* fixed Sanitizer issues
* Do dnsbl lookups more judiciously. Anti-spam effectiveness is undiminished,
  but the application is more responsive.
* Fix a Session CookieOverflow when rescuing Instiki::ValidationError
* Domain independent caching
* Fix for no Flash Messages 
* Links on “published” Webs were all screwed-up. Fixed.
* Make uploaded pictures display in the “published” view.
* Make @import rules in the “Stylesheet Tweaks” work in the “published” view.
* Actually verify the password, when setting a password for a Web, rather than
  just pretending to do so.
* fixes for nowiki “<nowiki>[[!include foo]]</nowiki>”)
* Hide Equations From WikiChunk Processing
* Fix a bug in the Chunk handler, which was mangling backslashes in included
  pages.
* Entering the wrong password on the “CreateWeb” form now redirects back to
  the form, as it should.
* Allow single-letter WikiLinks (e.g. “[[a]]”). Requested by a Japanese user.
* Allow single-letter includes (e.g. “[[!include a]]”).
* Huge improvements to caching and cache-sweeping
* Category listing restricts to current Web.
* All WikiReference methods limit results to the current web
* File uploads work right.
* Make WEBrick respond to TERM signal. (Launchd, in particular, requires this.)
* Ditch the URIChunk and LocalURIChunk handlers. Slow, buggy, and of dubious
  utility.
* Ensure unsafe operations (new, save,...) are POSTs, not GETs.
* Fix utf-8 bug in WikiChunk handling.
* Disable WikiChunk processing in tags.
* Hide Equations From WikiChunk Processing
* Fix for the "Backslashes in Included Equations" bug.
* Sessions are now stored in a cookie (signed and Base-64 encoded).
  Form_spam_protection stores form_keys in the session.
  Make sure spambots implement both cookies and javascript, by storing
  hashed (with salt) keys in the session.
* Make sure request.ip is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
* Make remove_orphaned_pages work in a proxied situation.
* In the wiki_controller, only apply the dnsbl_check before_filter 
  to the :edit, :new, and :save :export actions, instead of all actions.
  This makes mundane "show" requests faster, but does not 
  compromise spam-fighting ability.
* Be a little gentler in recovering from Instiki::ValidationErrors, when
  saving a page. Previously, we threw away all the user's changes upon
  the redirect. Now we attempt to salvage what he wrote.
* Drop hostname from cache key.
* Fix Recursive Includes.
* Entering an incorrect password on the Create Web form should redirect
  back to the form, with a flash error.
* In the Stylesheet Tweaks, the owner of a Web can specify an @import rule
  to pull in CSS styles form an external file. This worked in the "show"
  view, but was broken in the "published" view. Fixed.
* Allow multiple leading capital letters in a WikiWord.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.13.0:

Mainly a Bugfix Release, which fixes two XSS Vulnerabilities.

     contents processed by the markup engine, but without the default layout -

     opening and closing tags were on the same line only)

   - RSS feed with page contents for a password-protected web behaves as 
     follows: if the web is published, RSS feed links to the published version 
     of the web. otherwise, the feed is not available
     Madeleine will check every hour if there are new commands in the log or
     24 hours have passed since last snapshot, and take snapshot if either of

     file in ./storage
